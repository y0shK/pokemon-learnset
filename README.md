# pokemon-learnset
This is a project to improve my HTML/CSS and JavaScript skills by creating a useful HTML app, hosted via GitHub Pages, that provides information about what moves any given Pokemon will learn in any given generation. It's a fun way to learn HTML and JavaScript, and it'll be useful resource for me when I play Pokemon!
